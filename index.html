                    <p class="testimonial-text">What impressed me most was Seira's outstanding design sense and English language skills. Creating a logo and website was a completely new experience for me. During our meetings, she listened attentively and helped draw out my vision for the site. She clearly explained what I needed to do, and delivered everything by our target completion date, which was incredibly helpful.
                      <br></br>
                      As a writer, I also asked her to translate my written work (poems and stories) into English. Translation requires deep familiarity with both languages and an understanding of both cultures. Seira translated my work more beautifully than I could have imagined, achieving results that were far beyond my own English abilities and expression. Thanks to her English translations, my readership expanded from 'Japanese people' to 'people around the world.' This is truly remarkable.
                      <br></br>
                      Seira is always calm and full of wonderful ideas. Her natural sense and creativity are exceptional, and I felt completely comfortable entrusting my project to her. Of course, she also respected my opinions and feedback, so we could create together without compromising—I could always say 'I prefer this!' The finished website exceeded all my expectations and imagination, which makes me truly happy.
                      <br></br>
                      Even after the website was completed, she responded quickly whenever I wanted to make adjustments, and I'm deeply grateful for that. The site has already received feedback from readers, and <span style="background-color:yellow;">my Instagram followers <strong>increased by about 80 people in just one week.</strong></span> I look forward to continuing to work with her for a long time to come!</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">Seira was patient and diligent in helping design my logo first and then my website. I was so happy with the results, I didn't hesitate to share it with friends and families I was working with. Being a small-first time business owner I wanted something that reflected my personality and show case  a high quality service I wanted to provide; both the logo and website demonstrate that and I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend Seira and would definitely work with her again. </p>

        <h2 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How long will it take to build my website?</summary>
          <p>It usually takes 4 to 16 weeks, depending on the size, features, and overall scope of the project. A standard website typically takes about 8 to 12 weeks. After learning more about your needs, I’ll provide a clear timeline so you know what to expect at every stage.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How much does a website cost?</summary>
          <p>Pricing depends on your specific goals, desired features, and the complexity of your project. I offer flexible packages ranging from simple one-page websites to full-featured, bilingual sites with custom design and integrations.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>One-language websites</strong> (1–5 pages): $1,000 – $3,000</li>
            <li><strong>Custom or multilingual websites</strong>, including cultural translation: $4,000 – $8,000+</li>
            <li><strong>UX/UI design + development</strong> with cross-cultural strategy: $5,000 – $12,000</li>
         </ul>
          <p>If you’re not sure what you need yet, no worries! I’m happy to learn more about your project and provide a custom quote that fits your goals and budget. Together, we’ll explore the best options so you can make an informed decision—no pressure, just honest guidance.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
         <summary>What do I need to get started?</summary>
         <p>We’ll start with a conversation to understand your goals. After that, you’ll need your logo (if you have one), brand colors, photos, and content—but don’t worry, I’ll guide you through everything step by step.</p>
         </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
         <summary>Will I be able to update the website myself?</summary>
         <p>Yes! I build user-friendly websites and provide a walkthrough so you feel confident making updates—like swapping photos or editing text—without needing to touch any code.</p>
        </details>

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What if I don't have a logo or branding yet?</summary>
            <p>No problem! I offer logo and brand design services as part of my web design packages or as a standalone option. If you’re starting from scratch or want to refresh your existing look, I can help create a brand identity that feels true to your business and resonates with your audience.</p>
          </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
         <summary>Can you help with copywriting or translating content?</summary>
         <p>Yes! I can assist with writing or refining your website content in English and Japanese. Whether you need help organizing your message, writing from scratch, or translating existing content, I’ll make sure your words are clear, engaging, and aligned with your brand voice.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
         <summary>Do you only work with Japanese clients?</summary>
         <p>Not at all! I work with clients from all over the world. While I specialize in bilingual and cross-cultural projects involving Japanese and English, I welcome anyone who’s looking for a thoughtful, design-focused approach to building their web presence.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Do you speak English or Japanese?</summary>
          <p>Both! I’m fluent in English and Japanese, so we can communicate in the language you're most comfortable with. This is especially helpful for bilingual websites or international projects.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
         <summary>Do you build only English websites or Japanese websites?</summary>
         <p>I build websites in both English and Japanese, as well as bilingual sites that seamlessly integrate both languages. Whether you need a site in one language or a fully bilingual experience, I tailor the design and content to suit your audience and business goals.</p>
